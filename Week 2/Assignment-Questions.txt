1. Theoretical Assignment -
    Derive the formulas to calculate minimum mass, mass function and projected semimajor axis from Radial Velocity (RV) curves of Spectroscopic Binary (SB) Stars. 

2. Programming Assignment -
     Model SB star system and plot RV curves and orbit of the system. Target systems - Alpha Centauri, Mizar, or any famous SB star system.

3. Proposal - 
    Submit a proposal stating your goals for this project and what would you want to achieve by the end of 2 months. You can propose anything you want as far as it is related to the topic. For ex. literature review, animations and simulations, fitting a real dataset, various EB modelling package/fitting techniques comparison, creating your own python package relating to EBs, etc.
